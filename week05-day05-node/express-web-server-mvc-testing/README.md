##Why automate testing

. new ode might break existing functionality - referred to as regression
. to catch bugs before production
. quicker (and cheaper) than manual testing
. can be scheduled to run without human input
. helps you to think about your code structure - makes it more readable for tests and thus makes it better
. gives you more confidence in your code - WHICH IS MEGA!
. fix bug, write tests for it - makes the process more fluent - TDD
